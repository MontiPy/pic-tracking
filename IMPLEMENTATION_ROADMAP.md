# V2 Implementation Roadmap & Coordination Plan

## Executive Summary

This roadmap coordinates the migration from the current dual-model architecture to the new v2 design (TaskType→TaskTypeSection→Task→ProjectTaskTemplate→SupplierTaskInstance) across 6 specialized agent domains. The implementation follows a zero-downtime, phased approach ensuring business continuity while delivering significant UX improvements.

## Key Changes Summary

### Data Model Evolution
- **Remove**: Milestone entity, ProjectMilestoneTask complexity
- **Add**: TaskTypeSection (replaces Milestone), simplified ProjectTaskTemplate
- **Enhance**: Task model with sub-task support (1-level nesting), due date propagation logic

### Technical Stack Changes  
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS → CSS Modules + design tokens
- **UI Libraries**: Add TanStack Table/Query, dnd-kit, Zustand
- **Interaction**: Form-based → inline editing, keyboard-first navigation
- **Views**: Single view → Table/Board/Timeline with saved configurations

| **DEVOPS_ENGINEER** | Package updates, build config | None | Week 1 |
| **BACKEND_API** | API restructure, endpoints | Database schema | Weeks 2-3 |
| **FRONTEND_UI** | Component migration, new stack | API endpoints, packages | Weeks 3-5 |
| **UX_DESIGNER** | Interaction patterns, accessibility | UI components | Weeks 4-6 |

- [ ] Mobile experience fully functional
- [ ] User workflows validated

### Phase 5: Cleanup & Launch (Weeks 5-6)
**Goal**: Remove legacy code and launch v2

**Critical Path Items:**
1. **DATABASE_ARCHITECT**: Remove deprecated models
2. **BACKEND_API**: Remove legacy endpoints

## Risk Management & Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Owner | Mitigation |
|------|------------|---------|-------|------------|
| Data loss during migration | Low | Critical | PRODUCT_MANAGER | Full backup, validation scripts, rollback plan |
| API breaking changes | Medium | High | BACKEND_API | Feature flags, backward compatibility |
| UX disruption | Medium | Medium | UX_DESIGNER | Progressive disclosure, user testing |
| Performance regression | Medium | Medium | QA_ENGINEER | Baseline testing, optimization |

### Rollback Strategy

**Immediate Rollback** (< 24 hours):
1. Database restore from pre-migration backup
2. Code rollback to stable branch
3. Application restart

**Selective Rollback** (Feature-specific):
1. Toggle feature flags to legacy mode
2. Component-level rollback for UI issues
3. API endpoint rollback for integration issues

## Communication Plan

### Weekly Sync Points
- **Monday**: Cross-agent dependency review
- **Wednesday**: Progress checkpoint and blocker resolution  
- **Friday**: Demo/validation session

### Decision Points & Escalation
- **Schema Changes**: DATABASE_ARCHITECT → All agents
- **API Breaking Changes**: BACKEND_API → FRONTEND_UI, QA_ENGINEER
- **UX Changes**: UX_DESIGNER → FRONTEND_UI, QA_ENGINEER
- **Performance Issues**: Any agent → QA_ENGINEER, DEVOPS_ENGINEER
